\item  A hiker stands on the edge of a cliff 490 m above the ground and throws a stone horizontally with an initial speed of 15 $m s^{-1}$
. Neglecting air resistance,
find the time taken by the stone to reach the ground, and the speed with which it hits the ground. (Take g = 9.8 $m s^{-2}$
).

\item A man can swim with a speed of 4.0 km/h in still water. How long does he take to cross a river 1.0 km wide if the river flows steadily at 3.0 km/h and he makes his strokes normal to the river current? How far down the river does he go when he reaches the other bank ?

\item In a harbour, wind is blowing at the speed of 72 km/h and the flag on the mast of a boat anchored in the harbour flutters along the N-E direction. If the boat starts moving at a speed of 51 km/h to the north, what is the direction of the flag on the mast of the boat ?

\item A bullet fired at an angle of 30$\degree$ with the horizontal hits the ground 3.0 km away. By adjusting its angle of projection, can one hope to hit a target 5.0 km away ? Assume the muzzle speed to be fixed, and neglect air resistance.
\item  A fighter plane flying horizontally at an altitude of 1.5 km with speed 720 km/h passes directly overhead an anti-aircraft gun. At what angle from the vertical should the gun be fired for the shell with muzzle speed 600 $m s^{-1}$ to hit the plane ? 
At what minimum  altitude should the pilot fly the plane to avoid being hit ? (Take g = 10$ m s^{-2}$
).
\item Give the magnitude and direction of the net force acting on a stone of mass 0.1 kg, 
\begin{enumerate}
\item  just after it is dropped from the window of a stationary train, 
\item  just after it is dropped from the window of a train running at a constant velocity of 36 km/h,
\item  just after it is dropped from the window of a train accelerating with 1$ m s^{-2} $
\item  lying on the floor of a train which is accelerating with 1 $m s^{-2}$, the stone being at rest relative to the train.
\end{enumerate}
Neglect air resistance throughout. 

\item Consider the collision depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:6.10} to be between two billiard balls with equal masses $m_1= m_2$.  The first ball is called the cue while the second ball is called the target. The billiard player wants to 'sink' the target ball in a corner pocket, which is at an angle $\theta_2=37\degree$.  Assume that the collosion
is elastic and that friction and rotational motion are not important. Obtain $\theta_1$.
