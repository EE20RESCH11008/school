\item One morning, each member of Manjul's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee and milk. The amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, but were never zero. Manjul drank $(\frac{1}{7})^{th}$ of the total amount of milk and 
$(\frac{2}{17})^{th}$ of the total amount of coffee. How many people are there in Manjul's family?

\item Let 
\begin{align*}
x_{1}, x_{2},....,x_{2014}
\end{align*}
be real numbers different from 1, such that 
\begin{align*}
x_{1} + x_{2} +,....,+ x_{2014} = 1
\end{align*} 
\begin{align*}
\frac{x_1}{1 - x_1} + \frac{x_2}{1 - x_2} +...... + \frac{x_{2014}}{1 - x_{2014}} = 1
\end{align*}
What is the value of  
\begin{align*}
\frac{x_1^2}{1 - x_1} + \frac{x_2^2}{1 - x_2} + \frac{x_3^2}{1 - x_3}...... + \frac{x^2_{2014}}{1 - x_{2014}}?
\end{align*}

\item If real numbers a, b, c, d, e satisfy 
\begin{align*}
a + 1 = b + 2 = c + 3 = d + 4 \\= e + 5 = a + b + c + d + e + 3,
\end{align*}
What is the value of 
\begin{align*}
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2
\end{align*}


\item If $x^{x^{4}} = 4$, what is the value of$x^{x^{2}} + x^{x^{8}}$?
